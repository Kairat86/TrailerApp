This app shows most popular and top rated movies from The Movie DB. You need to create  
'gradle.properties' file and put api_key string resource there 
which you can get from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api.

This source code is also available on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/Kairat86/TrailerApp.git
